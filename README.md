# Hyperspectral
Low-cost hyperspectral sensor for invasive species detection. Access models, data, and compute stack for real-time detection of invasive animals in complex environments. Developed under a DoD US Department of Defense Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) and field-tested with Island Conservation onboard a UAS, this project advances hyperspectral imaging and ML for conservation. Open for adaptation and collaboration to advance remote sensing for ecological conservation.

Annex A: Final Report outlines the methedology employed and summarises results achieved.

The research and project was undertaken by spectrabotics and Island Conservation.
