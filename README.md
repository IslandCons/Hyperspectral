# Hyperspectral
Low-cost hyperspectral sensor for invasive species detection. Access models, data, and compute stack for real-time detection of invasive animals in complex environments. Developed under a DoD STTR and field-tested with UAS, this project advances hyperspectral imaging and ML for conservation. Open for adaptation and collaboration.
